                <p class="recipe-description">I was born in New Zealand, and when we lived there we would often make afghans cookies as a special treat. This recipe has been passed down in my family for generations, from my great grandmother. It came from a cookbook called: Edmonds Cookery Book, which is the second best selling book in New Zealand. Almost everyone who lived there had a copy of it at the time, and in my family it was passed down for generations until now we have this cookbook and the recipe that we make now is the same one that my great grandmother made many years ago.

                <p class="recipe-subtitle">History</p>
                <p class="recipe-description">No one really knows the history of afghan cookies but one of the theories that I've been seeing a lot is that they were baked for soldiers during the afghan war.</p>
                
                <p class="recipe-subtitle">Instructions</p>
                <p class="recipe-description">In a medium sized bowl, cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.</p>
